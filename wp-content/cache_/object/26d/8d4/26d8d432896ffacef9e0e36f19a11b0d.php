<h4>CONCEPT &amp; DESIGN</h4>
[/mk_fancy_title][vc_column_text animation="bottom-to-top"]Getting the visual architecture right is a critical step in delivering a great <strong>UserÂ Experience (UX)</strong>. We initiate this phase by mapping out the navigational structure and screen layout, generally known as the wire-frame. Wire-frames validate the usability of an application by allowing the user the visualise and navigate through all the sections. During this process we prepare strategic arrangement of elements throughout the entire application. Based on the wire-frame we initiateÂ the branding and design to deliver what will be the visual masterpiece of the application every user will see when they use the application.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="Section 2" tab_id="1490874003496-4f4a0752-8ffc"][mk_fancy_title tag_name="h4" color="#f05d27" font_family="none" animation="right-to-left"]
<h4>DEVELOPMENT</h4>
[/mk_fancy_title][vc_column_text animation="bottom-to-top"]Design slicing and integration into the user interface is the first step of the development stage. Engaging in extensive hours of programming our developers strategically formulate the functional parameters of the application and database structure. During development, you will have a direct and open line of communication with your project manager who willÂ keep you up to date with the progression of your project.[/vc_column_text][mk_button dimension="outline" corner_style="rounded" size="medium" url="https://giqk9lga.dreamwp.com/contact-us/" margin_top="10" margin_bottom="0" margin_right="0" outline_skin="custom" outline_active_color="#f05d27" outline_active_text_color="#f05d27" outline_hover_bg_color="#f05d27" outline_hover_color="#ffffff"]Enquire Now[/mk_button][/vc_tta_section][vc_tta_section title="Section 3" tab_id="1490874263780-5bb9fd8c-498b"][mk_fancy_title tag_name="h4" color="#f05d27" font_family="none" animation="right-to-left"]
<h4>TESTING &amp; LAUNCH</h4>
[/mk_fancy_title][vc_column_text animation="bottom-to-top"]Your project is tested internally at progressive intervals. We do in-depth assessment on the usability, functionality, performance, security and device compatibility to ensure you receive a bug-free application ready to rock the marketplace. You will also receive a a range of BETA versions to test on your device(s) before the launch. This way weÂ make sure your app is at 100% upon final delivery.

We guide you with the entire process of what is required to have the application published in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store globally.

If your platform is for private business/company use, then we do not launch your app into the app stores.[/vc_column_text][/vc_tta_section][/vc_tta_pageable][/vc_column][/vc_row][mk_page_section bg_color="#f6f6f6" border_color="rgba(0,0,0,0.3)" attachment="fixed" bg_position="center center" bg_repeat="no-repeat" bg_stretch="true" enable_3d="true" top_shadow="true" min_height="0" padding_top="80" padding_bottom="60" first_page="false" last_page="false" sidebar="sidebar-1"][vc_column][mk_fancy_title color="#f05d27" size="48" txt_transform="capitalize" letter_spacing="1" margin_bottom="40" font_family="Montserrat" font_type="google" align="center"]MEET THE FOUNDERS[/mk_fancy_title][vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner width="1/4"][vc_icon icon_fontawesome="fa fa-spinner" color="custom" size="lg" align="center" custom_color="#f05d27"][mk_fancy_title font_family="none" align="center" animation="left-to-right"]
